## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

Notes
keep the code you're showing as clean as you can
tests are a must-have
build a CI pipeline for your repo (Travis is super simple to use and free for open source)
add a static code analysis (I recommend code climate)
write a README with building and running instructions
extra points if it's dockerized and / or deployed somewhere
